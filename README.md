### Hi there 👋

<!--
**thatssotome/thatssotome** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
- 🔭 I’m currently working on multiple projects(medical, fashion, and social media platform) and I am using different Hackathon's events to have a chance to fully work on all my ideas.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about anything and everything. Well, I double dutch between the two major IT field and the computer coding and network and system's configuration. So I will code for a little bit and finish a project, then I go back and do a little networking and security. Get you a girl that can do both. 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on my major project: MOB-IV. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love fried chicken, the key to my heart. 
- 📫 How to reach me: Email, because it is professional: admin@tieumithi.com or other social media platform: @thatssotome
