### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**thatssotome/thatssotome** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on multiple projects(medical, fashion, and social media platform) and I am using Hackathon to have a chance to fully work on all my ideas.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning anything and everything. Well, I double dutch between the IT field and the coding aspects. So I will code for a little bit and finish a project, then I go back and do a little networking and security. Get you a girl that can do both. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on my major project, MOB-IV. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love fried chicken, the key to my heart. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Email, because it is professional: admin@tieumithi.com or social media: @thatssotome
